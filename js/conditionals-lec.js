// Conditionals: Code that runs when we meet certain requirements.

// Today we'll be covering if, if/else, if/else if/else statements, ternary expressions and switch statements.

// IF STATEMENTS - Code that runs when a condition is met.

 //if (condition) {
//     this code will run if our condition is true;
//}

// Action: I go to the store to get more milk.

// We can also use our conditional logic in functions.

// IF/ELSE Statements: Code that runs when a condition is met, but will also run with a default state.

//if (condition) {
//     i run when the condition evaluates to true;
//} else {
//     otherwise i run;
// }
